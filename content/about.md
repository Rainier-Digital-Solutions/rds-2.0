#### Killing the Pain of Building & Maintaining Websites

Rainier Digital Solutions wants to take away the burden of building and maintaining websites for startups and Small & Medium Businesses (SMBs). Too many times these types of businesses have to split their attention between what matters to their core business (generating leads, attending to customers, developing the next generation of software, etc.) to attend to the mundane task of building a website and keeping it updated with content relevant to their customers.

#### SMBs

In the world of business, small to medium-sized enterprises (SMBs) are the backbone of various industries. SMB owners possess operational acumen and profound sector expertise, enabling them to navigate their industries with ease. However, their unique strengths often lead to a crucial challenge — digital presence. This is where Rainier Digital Solutions steps in, offering a tailored solution for SMBs with a distinct focus on web development and SEO optimization.

We're here to bridge the gap between operational excellence and digital proficiency. By partnering with us, SMBs tap into a wealth of expertise in web development and SEO optimization. Our dedicated team of professionals, all veterans with coding bootcamp or professional experience, ensures that every digital endeavor is a masterpiece.

#### Technology Startups

In the dynamic landscape of technology startups, visionary founders are driven by innovation and ambition. However, the path to securing vital investments demands a multifaceted approach — one where Rainier Digital Solutions plays a pivotal role. Our unique focus on technology startups stems from the founder's firsthand experience in technology investment banking, equipping us with insights that pave the way for startups to stand out in a crowded market.

Rainier Digital Solutions steps in as a strategic ally, anchoring startups with a robust digital presence for investors while they focus on building their technological marvels. Our expertise bridges the gap between technology and investor readiness, transforming a startup’s website, online pitch deck, and prototype applications into polished, investor-friendly assets. By entrusting these aspects to us, founders can concentrate on propelling their core offerings and securing investments that propel growth.

#### Full-Service

With our Full-Service solution, we handle your businesses online technology needs. Many companies think that having an online presence ends with having a website, but there is so much more involved.

- How are you getting found?
- What is your advertising strategy?
- Is your website optimized for Google's Search Engine (SEO Optimized)?
- Do you have a custom email domain to show credibility to customers?
- When does your domain expire?
- Is your DNS configured correctly?
- How and when will you produce content for your website to stay top of mind with customers and rank higher on Google?

The list goes on, but you get the idea.

We want to offload the burden of answering those questions by partnering with you so that you can focus on running your business.

#### Empowering U.S. Military Veterans

We proudly collaborate with esteemed coding boot camps, where our journey with veterans commences. These courageous individuals graduate as skilled coders, ready to embark on a new journey. At Rainier Digital Solutions, we take them under our wing, providing them with the chance to apply their newly acquired skills while building a robust portfolio.

With the guidance of experienced professionals and the support of a collaborative community, our veterans work on projects that span various industries, honing their skills while contributing to tangible solutions. We believe that every line of code is an opportunity for growth, empowerment, and innovation.
